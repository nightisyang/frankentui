# Fixes Summary - Session 2026-02-01 (Part 22)

## 59. Markdown Link Rendering
**File:** `crates/ftui-extras/src/markdown.rs`
**Issue:** `MarkdownRenderer` was parsing links but discarding the destination URL, meaning `[text](url)` was rendered with link styling but no actual link functionality (OSC 8).
**Fix:**
    - Updated `StyleContext` to include `Link(String)` variant.
    - Updated `RenderState` to track the current link URL in the style stack.
    - Updated `text()` and `inline_code()` to apply the current link URL to generated `Span`s using the new `Span::link()` method.
    - Note: Verified `RenderState` updates correctly handle nested styles and link scopes.

## 60. Final Codebase State
All tasks are complete. The codebase has been extensively refactored for Unicode correctness, hardened for security/reliability, and enhanced with hyperlink support. No further issues detected in the sampled files.
