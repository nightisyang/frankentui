# Policy for tests/e2e/scripts/test_remote_resize_storm_cross_browser_diff.sh
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Fields in `browser_env` (browser name/version/user agent/platform/headless)
#   are intentionally excluded from semantic diff checks because host metadata
#   is expected to vary per browser by design.
# - Timing-dependent fields (for example duration_ms) are intentionally excluded
#   from semantic diff checks because they are non-deterministic across hosts.
# - Current policy accepts zero semantic divergences by default.
#
# Add entries only when a divergence is explicitly approved and documented:
# <class>\t<left_browser>\t<right_browser>\t<path_pattern>\t<rationale>
#
# Example (disabled):
# frame_count	chromium	webkit	frames.length	Transport flush ordering can emit one extra frame in webkit during close-drain; tracked by bd-2vr05.15.1.7 follow-up.
