#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Internationalization (i18n) foundation for FrankenTUI.
//!
//! Provides externalized string storage with key-based lookup,
//! locale fallback chains, ICU-style plural forms, and variable
//! interpolation.
//!
//! # Role in FrankenTUI
//! `ftui-i18n` isolates localization concerns so widgets and apps can
//! remain deterministic while still supporting multiple languages.
//!
//! # How it fits in the system
//! Widgets and demo screens can depend on this crate to resolve strings
//! into localized text before rendering. It does not depend on rendering or
//! runtime, keeping the localization layer reusable and testable.
